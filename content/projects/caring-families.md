I volunteer at the Women's Center of Eastern Connecticut's Willimantic Office as a male advocate so when Caring Families was looking to redesign their donor website I was more than happy to help. The theme is completely custom, built from the ground up.

Some other features include a beautiful, completely user controlled front page slideshow, a custom region on the front page counting down the time to the next major event, and a gallery.`,
