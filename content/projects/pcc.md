The Presbyterian Church of Coventry is my home church. I redesigned their website when I first became a member in 2013, but when 2019 rolled around it was starting to look a little dated.

We redesigned it from the ground up using Gridsome, Bulma (with some Tailwind), and NetlifyCMS. The site is super fast now, includes progressive images out-of-the-box, and features a sleek, modern design.
