The Presbyterian Church of Coventry is my home church. Recently we were looking to do a redesign. The website is fully responsive and pulls in tweets from @CoventryPCA. It has a customizable front page slideshow and even a system that can be usedbroadcast alerts at the top of the site for things like snow cancellations, etc.
