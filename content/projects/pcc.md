PCC is my home church and we redesigned their site from the ground up using Gridsome and Tailwind (with some Bulma), and NetlifyCMS. The site is extremely performant, uses progressive images, features a sleek & modern design, and implements an infinite loading technique for various content.

Bulletins are pulled in automatically from an S3 bucket during the build process and sermons include a number of relationships and can be filtered by series, author, and book.
