Lebanon Bible Church was the second church website I built from the ground up. Pastor Roger was a great client to work with as he and I really had similar desires as to how a church website should look and function. The gospel is beautiful, so shouldn't that be reflected in a church website as well? There were a number of features we integrated that I really spent some time polishing including: galleries, sermons and sermon series, and an event calendar.
