  'We _love_ the web site that Cody designed for us. He made it a very easy and painless process, making suggestions along the way, helping with photos and videos and answering many questions. He was sensitive to the needs of our school's content, character, and educational philosophy. Our site is colorful, informative and tastefully done. We have had many comments from prospective parents asking 'who' designed our wonderful website. We are very pleased with the job Mr. Barr did for our school.'
